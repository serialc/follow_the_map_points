# Follow the data
A simple webmap that replicates the movement provided in GeoJSON data, in real-time. 

Beyond gaining familiarity with the GeoJSON format, this program allows the communication of the spatial relationship of a tracked object relative to the surroundings in real-time.

A few additional features are available:
- Time dilation to allow slow-motion or sped up movement
- Addition of other GeoJSON features for comparison

This has various applications for reporting data.

Contributions are welcome.
